### SpaceGame

SpaceGame is an object orented game that uses array lists and nested for loops. Shoot lasers at oncoming rocks to gain points and acheive your high score. Rocks, lasers, stars, and power ups are all made using array lists and nested for loops in order to get the smooth gameplay featured within. It allows the objects to move and intersect with the ship and its lasers, which impacts your score, ammmo, and health.
